## Project Structure
The project is structured as a monorepository. The api backend and app front-end can be found in their respective directories.

### API
- The language and framework I decided to go with for the API is PHP and [Laravel](https://laravel.com). I know, PHP sucks. But Laravel makes PHP good.
- Laravel is a modern framework and very similar to [nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). Out of the box it provides a lot of the tools that are needed for this project.
- The project was scaffolded with the [Laravel Installer](https://github.com/laravel/installer) composer package.
- Endpoints are documented with [OpenApi](https://www.openapis.org/) and the UI is provided by [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc)

### App
- The app is javascript (typescript) using [react](https://react.dev/)
- The project was scaffolded with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
